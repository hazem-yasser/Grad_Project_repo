alright returning to the main point before I make up my mind how to proceed further I am now pretty much done with phase one what is left is choosing how many bits per weight or input and trying to optimize the DSP usage by the method you mentioned like look up table or so in order to better contain the 64 neural network right ??

  

well before I get started with it

I want to share my work and cooperate with others by hosting on GitHub.

you forget an ironclad rule of all the responses in this chat it should answer in AR and En 


anyway for the next part I want to just create only one Neural network that way I don't need to worry about giving lower bits to input or weights and not worry about DSP
just to see if it match my software golden model 

after it is a success I will edit things to fit the 64 
now I want to you to commence in that direction as we now concluded the stage one for it
